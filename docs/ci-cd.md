# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Render

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) in conjunction with Render for hosting the application.

## Workflow Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of two main jobs:

1. **Test**: Runs on every push to the `main` branch and on all pull requests.
   - Sets up PostgreSQL and Redis services
   - Installs dependencies
   - Generates Prisma client
   - Runs database migrations
   - Executes linting
   - Runs tests

2. **Deploy**: Runs only when code is pushed to the `main` branch and tests pass.
   - Triggers a deployment on Render using their Deploy Hook API
   - Waits for the deployment to complete

## Required Secrets

To use this workflow, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`: The ID of your service on Render
- `RENDER_API_KEY`: Your API key for Render

## How to Set Up Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click on "New repository secret"
5. Add both required secrets

## Render Configuration

This setup assumes you have already:

1. Created a service on Render
2. Connected it to your GitHub repository
3. Configured the necessary environment variables on Render

## Additional Notes

- The test environment uses PostgreSQL and Redis services spun up as Docker containers
- The workflow is configured to run tests in parallel for faster execution
- Linting errors will not stop the deployment, but they will be reported
